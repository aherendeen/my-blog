My name is Andrew Herendeen and I'm a business consultant and developer from St. George, Utah. I have a passion for solving complex problems and helping businesses improve their operations through technology. In my free time, I enjoy playing chess, reading, exploring new ideas in the tech space, and contributing to open source projects.
